Subject: Rat Game

Game rules, logic and objective:
A simple game that resembles Xonix in many respects. Player controls a rat,
whose objective is to eat all of the pieces of cheese located in the playing
field. When rat starts moving, its tail start to stretch behind it, covering
rat's track. When rat reaches an edge of the playing field, the tail
disappears. Game also contains hazards, a certain amount of balls. They bounce
off walls, pieces of cheese and other balls. If a ball hits the rat or its
tail, player loses a life. Player loses a life also if the rat hits it's tail.
Once all of the pieces of cheese have been eaten, player proceeds to the next
level. Consequtive levels increase the amount of balls by one. Game ends when
player loses all of her/his lives. Extra lives are given when player reaches
certain amount of points.
