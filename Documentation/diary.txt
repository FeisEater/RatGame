16.12.2013	Created a github repository, created a project directory,
		wrote a short project description, other text files.
		2 hours.

		Implemented a timer. Made some test for it, that don't
		exactly cover everything. 3 hours.

17.12.2013	Added some constant variables. 30 minutes
		Implemented an Entity and its subclass Ball. Balls can
		move. Added appropriate tests. 1,5 hours.

		Moved ball's moving functionality to the MoveableEntity
		superclass. Added Rat that inherits it. Made appropriate
		tests. 1 hour.

		Figured out how to implement an EntityList, that can
		filter entities by the interface they implement. Started
		making tests for it. 2 hours.

		Fixed up iheritance. 30 minutes.

18.12.2013	Implemented ball's bouncing ability. Took longer than
		expected, no tests yet. 2,5 hours.

		Removed temporarily ball's bouncing ability, migrated
		collision detection algorithm to Moveable. Made more
		thorough tests. 2 hours.

		Reimplemented ball's bouncing ability. Going to test
		it tomorrow. 2 hours.

19.12.2013	Made tests for Ball. Readjusted packages. 1 hour.

		Added tail stretching and cheese eating abilities for
		Rat. Ball calls Rat's die() method when it hits Rat or
		its tail. Made some tests for all of this except the
		dying ability. 4 hours.

20.12.2013	Added Hidable interface, Border class that implements it.
		Redesigned collision responsibilities, will finish tomorrow.
		2 hours.

21.12.2013	Moved checkCollisions() method to Moveable, implementations
		must call reactToCollision() to do appropriate actions
		depending on object collided upon. Added removeAll() method
		to EntityList

		Integrated tail creation algorithm with the new checkCollision()
		method. Cleaned up other things in the code. 30 minutes.

		Refactored code involving position correction after collision,
		most of the code is now in Moveable class. 1 hour.

22.12.2013	Caught up with testing. Many things are not tested multiple
		times. Also testing code may have to be cleaned up. 1,5 hours.

		Rat can kill itself if it collides with its own tail. I don't
		test for dying for now because I didn't implement any
		concequences for death yet. 1 hour.

23.12.2013	Made the program run an updatable window. Removed redundant
		methods from Tools (FindAllClasses()). 1,5 hours.

		Demoed to myself how ball bounces off window's borders.
		30 minutes.
