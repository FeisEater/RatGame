Some tests may occasionally fail. They, however, should pass if tests are
run again. There are two reasons for this:

-Several tests are based on random chance. For example
whenAllCheeseIsEatenResetCheese() takes one cheese before position reset
then takes one cheese after position reset and compares their coordinates.
There is a chance that these coordinates will be the same, causing the
test to fail.

-Several tests are based on the timer functionality. On slower machines
or when machine is preoccupied with miscellaneous code editor services
these tests may fail because timer may work at a different speed than expected.

Many tests fail if constant values in static classes are changed for game
design.
