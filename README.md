rat's track. When rat reaches an edge of the playing field, the tail
disappears. Game also contains hazards, a certain amount of balls that bounce
off walls, pieces of cheese and other balls. If a ball hits the rat or its
tail, player loses a life. Player loses a life also if the rat hits it's tail.
